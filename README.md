# Face_Expression_Recognizer
Python-program

This repository includes deep learning based project implementations I've done from scratch. You can find both the source code and documentation as a step by step tutorial. Model structrues and pre-trained weights are shared as well.

Facial Expression Recognition Code

This is a custom CNN model. Kaggle FER 2013 data set is fed to the model. This model runs fast and produces satisfactory results. It can be also run real time as well.

**4.1. Install dependencies**
Tensorflow<br>
Tflearn<br>
Numpy<br>
Argparse<br>
[optional] Hyperopt + pymongo + networkx<br>
[optional] dlib, imutils, opencv 3<br>
[optional] scipy, pandas, skimage<br>
Better to use anaconda environemnt to easily install the dependencies (especially opencv and dlib)<br>
**
4.2. Download and prepare the data**
Download Fer2013 dataset and the Face Landmarks model<br>

Kaggle Fer2013 challenge<br>
Dlib Shape Predictor model<br>
Unzip the downloaded files<br>

And put the files fer2013.csv and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat in the root folder of this package.
